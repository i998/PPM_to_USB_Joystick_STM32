/*
Original library is from https://github.com/Nikkilae/PPM-reader
Updated by IF 
2021-03-05
- disable interrupts when read from volatile variables outside of ISR (https://github.com/Nikkilae/PPM-reader/pull/1)
2018-01-13
- includes support for Maple Mini board / STM32 (https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/)
- updated Interrupt Service Routine function 
- added a timestamp that indicates when the latest data was received
- channels renumbered to start from 1  
- debug functionality added 
- comments added 
- return a faisafe code in channel[0] (similar to SBUS) if a loss of signal is detected 
  (Walkera returns a 800 us pulses in this case) 
TODO:  
- Consider to check if value are within the max/min values and with channelValueMaxError tolerance.
